 <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is one of the most popular multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBA) available for mobile devices. Developed and published by Moonton 2016, the first World Championship tournament took place just a month ago. In this Mobile Legends beginner guide, we’ll take a look at the basics of the game, its main features and how to get started easily. During a standard match, 2 teams featuring 5 players compete against each other on a map with 3 lanes and jungle areas in between. In order to claim victory, you have to destroy the enemy’s base before they can do the same. Each player can control a selectable character, called Hero, with individual abilities and traits.</p>
